            <H2 ALIGN="CENTER"> WHY TO ATTEND THIS EVENT?</H2>
            <ul>
                <li>Festival-goers love attending these events because it's their moment to escape from the real world.
                    In a sense, festivals create an opportunity for liberation, where you can express yourself without
                    anyone judging you. You can wear the most outrageous outfits, wear the silliest makeup or costume,
                    and people will actually celebrate you. In music festivals, anything goes when it comes to
                    expressing yourself, which is a freedom you don't get to experience any other day.</li> <br>
                <li>With thousands of people in one venue, making new friends becomes so easy in musical festivals. The
                    whole energy is positive and everyone's there to have a good time. It's one of the best chances to
                    make new friends who have the very same interests as you, or meet people you never even thought of
                    socializing with if you were out in the real world. </li> <br>
                <li>Festivals are the place where you get to see your favorite artist body surf to the mosh pit; where
                    you see surprise performances or collaborations by some of the world's best artists. A festival is a
                    place where unforgettable moments happen, creating experiences that are truly out of this world.
                    When it comes to multi-day festivals, you can camp on-site, where you get to share memorable moments
                    with your friends and new acquaintances. The entire atmosphere of a festival is welcoming, with
                    people in high spirits at all times. With positive vibes, incredible music playing, and everyone
                    having a great time, festivals can easily become one of your life's most unforgettable experiences.
                </li> <br>
                <li>a festival experience can totally change you, for the better. By opening up your mind to new
                    experiences, new people, and new music, your bubble or comfort zone will expand or break, allowing
                    you to grow through the experience.
                    Losing yourself to the music, having the freedom to be who you want to be for a night, and sharing
                    experiences with friends is what music festivals are all about. And if these reasons still don't
                    convince you, then you're truly missing out on one of the greatest experiences you can ever have in
                    this lifetime.</li>

            <pre>
                Better than Heaven or Arcadia
                I love thee, O my India!
                And thy love I shall give
                To every brother nation that lives.
                God made the Earth;
                Man made confining countries
                And their fancy-frozen boundaries.
                But with unfound boundless love
                I behold the borderland of my India
                Expanding into the World.
                Hail, mother of religions, lotus, scenic beauty,and sages!
                Thy wide doors are open,
                Welcoming God's true sons through all ages.
                Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves, and
                men dream God -
                I am hallowed; my body touched that sod.
                - Swami Yogananda Paramhansa
